# Component metadata `@Component`

The `@Component` decorator in Angular is a TypeScript decorator that is
used to annotate a class as an Angular component. It is part of the
Angular core library and provides metadata and configuration options for
the component.

The `@Component` decorator is typically applied to a class declaration
just before the class definition. Here's an example of how the
`@Component` decorator is used:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css'],
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  // Component class implementation...
}
```

The `@Component` decorator takes an object as an argument, which
contains various configuration properties for the component. Here are
some commonly used properties:

- `selector`: Specifies the way the component is identified and
  referenced within the application's templates. It can be a custom HTML
  tag, an attribute, or a CSS selector.

- `template` or `templateUrl`: Specifies the inline HTML template or the
  URL of an external HTML file that defines the component's UI
  structure. Only one of these properties should be used.

- `styleUrls`: Specifies an array of URLs to external CSS files that
  provide styles specific to the component. The styles defined here are
  scoped to the component's template.

These are just a few of the properties that can be used with the
`@Component` decorator. The decorator provides a way to configure and
define the behavior, appearance, and structure of an Angular component.

By applying the `@Component` decorator, the class is marked as an
Angular component, and Angular will use the specified metadata and
configurations to handle the component's rendering, behavior, and
interaction within the application.
