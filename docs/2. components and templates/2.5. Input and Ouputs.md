# @Input and @Output

In Angular, `@Input` and `@Output` are decorators used to establish
communication and data flow between components.

1. `@Input`: The `@Input` decorator allows a parent component to pass
   data to its child component. By applying the `@Input` decorator to a
   property in the child component, you indicate that it can receive
   data from its parent. The parent component can bind to this property
   using property binding syntax.

Example:

```typescript
// Child Component
@Input() message: string;

// Parent Component Template
<app-child [message]="parentMessage"></app-child>
```

2. `@Output`: The `@Output` decorator enables a child component to emit
   events to its parent component. It allows the child component to
   communicate changes or trigger actions in the parent component. By
   applying the `@Output` decorator to an event property in the child
   component, you create a custom event that the parent component can
   bind to using event binding syntax.

Example:

```typescript
// Child Component
@Output() notify: EventEmitter<string> = new EventEmitter<string>();

onClick() {
  this.notify.emit('Button clicked!');
}

// Parent Component Template
<app-child (notify)="handleNotification($event)"></app-child>
```

In the parent component, the `(notify)` event binding listens for the
`notify` event emitted by the child component. When the event is
triggered, the parent component's `handleNotification` method is
invoked, passing along any data emitted with the event.

Overall, `@Input` and `@Output` decorators facilitate the exchange of
data and events between components, enabling effective component
communication and allowing for building complex and interactive Angular
applications.
