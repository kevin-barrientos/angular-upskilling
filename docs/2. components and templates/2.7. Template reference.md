# Template Reference

In Angular, a template reference refers to a way of capturing a
reference to a template or an element within a template. It allows you
to interact with the template or the element programmatically from your
component code.

Template references are denoted by the `#` symbol followed by a name,
which you assign to the template or the element you want to reference.
This name can then be used within your component code to access
properties or methods of the referenced template or element.

Template references are commonly used in scenarios such as:

1. Accessing elements: You can use template references to access
   specific elements within a template and perform operations like
   manipulating the element's properties, adding event listeners, or
   applying styles.

2. Referencing templates: You can use template references to reference
   other templates within your component, allowing you to conditionally
   render or manipulate them.

3. Communicating with child components: When working with child
   components, you can use template references to interact with child
   component instances and access their properties or invoke methods.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of a template reference:

```html
<input #nameInput type="text" placeholder="Enter your name" /> <button (click)="greet(nameInput.value)">Greet</button>
```

In this example, we have an input element with the template reference
`#nameInput`. The template reference allows us to access the value of
the input field in the component code.

In the corresponding component class, you would define a method `greet`
that takes the value of the input as an argument and performs some
action:

```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  greet(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
}
```

In the `greet` method, we can access the value of the input field by
referencing the template reference `nameInput`.

Template references provide a way to establish a connection between the
template and the component code, allowing for more flexible and
interactive Angular applications.
