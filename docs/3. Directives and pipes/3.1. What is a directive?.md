# Directives

In Angular, a directive is a powerful feature that allows you to extend
the HTML syntax with custom behavior and functionality. Directives
enable you to create reusable components, manipulate the DOM, apply
styling, handle events, and interact with data within your Angular
application.

There are three types of directives in Angular:

1. Component Directives: Components are directives with a template. They
   are the most common and widely used type of directive in Angular. A
   component directive encapsulates the logic, UI, and behavior of a
   specific part of the application. It consists of a template that
   defines the view, a TypeScript class that encapsulates the
   component's behavior and data, and optional CSS styles for
   customizing the appearance.

2. Attribute Directives: Attribute directives modify the appearance or
   behavior of an existing HTML element. They do this by applying
   specific behavior or manipulating the element's attributes. Attribute
   directives are used by applying them to elements as attributes,
   typically using square brackets (`[]`), such as `[ngStyle]` or
   `[ngClass]`.

3. Structural Directives: Structural directives change the structure of
   the DOM by adding, removing, or manipulating elements. They are
   responsible for conditionally rendering or manipulating elements
   based on certain conditions. Structural directives are denoted by an
   asterisk (`*`) prefix in their syntax, such as `*ngIf` or `*ngFor`.

Angular provides several built-in directives that cover common use
cases, such as data binding (`ngModel`), event handling (`ngClick`),
conditional rendering (`ngIf`), looping (`ngFor`), and more. These
directives can be used out of the box, and you can also create your own
custom directives to add specific functionality to your application.

Custom directives allow you to encapsulate complex behavior and reuse it
across multiple parts of your application. They can be used to enhance
the functionality of existing HTML elements, create reusable UI
components, implement custom validation logic, integrate with
third-party libraries, or interact with the DOM directly.

Directives are an essential part of building Angular applications, as
they enable you to extend the HTML syntax and create powerful, reusable,
and customizable components and behaviors.
