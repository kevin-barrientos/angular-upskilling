# Structural directive limitation

In Angular, **an element cannot have two structural directives applied
simultaneously** because of the way structural directives are designed
and how they manipulate the DOM.

Structural directives, such as `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`, have
a special syntax that involves manipulating the DOM structure by adding,
removing, or repeating elements based on certain conditions. These
directives modify the structure of the DOM, and applying multiple
structural directives to the same element would result in conflicts and
ambiguity.

When you use a structural directive, it creates a structural template
that is responsible for rendering or modifying the DOM structure. The
directive marks a specific element as its host element and applies its
logic based on the given condition or iteration.

If multiple structural directives were applied to the same element,
there would be a conflict in terms of which directive should control the
DOM manipulation and rendering behavior. The directives would compete
for control over the element's structure, leading to unpredictable
results and potential conflicts in the rendered output.

## Solution

To overcome the limitation of having multiple structural directives on a
single element in Angular, you can use a container element or create a
custom directive that combines the functionality of multiple directives.
Here's an example of using a container element:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="condition1">
  <div *ngFor="let item of items">
    <!-- Content to be displayed -->
  </div>
</ng-container>
```

By enforcing the rule of
allowing only one structural directive per element, Angular ensures
clarity, consistency, and unambiguous behavior when manipulating the DOM
structure based on conditions or iterations.
