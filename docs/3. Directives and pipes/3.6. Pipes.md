# Pipes

In Angular, a pipe is a feature that allows you to transform and format
data within your templates. Pipes are used to apply common
transformations on values before they are displayed to the user. They
help to keep the template code concise and readable by encapsulating
data manipulation logic.

Pipes are denoted by the `|` symbol followed by the pipe name, and they
can be used with interpolation (`{{ }}`), property binding, and
attribute binding in Angular templates.

Here are a few examples of commonly used pipes in Angular:

1. **DatePipe**: The `date` pipe is used to format dates. It accepts a
   date object or string and applies the specified date format. For
   example:

   ```html
   <p>{{ currentDate | date:'dd/MM/yyyy' }}</p>
   ```

   This would display the current date in the format "dd/MM/yyyy".

2. **CurrencyPipe**: The `currency` pipe is used to format currency
   values. It accepts a number and a currency code and displays the
   formatted currency value. For example:

   ```html
   <p>{{ price | currency:'USD':'symbol' }}</p>
   ```

   This would display the value of `price` with the currency symbol of
   USD.

3. **UpperCasePipe/LowerCasePipe**: The `uppercase` and `lowercase`
   pipes are used to convert text to uppercase and lowercase,
   respectively. For example:

   ```html
   <p>{{ message | uppercase }}</p>
   <p>{{ name | lowercase }}</p>
   ```

   This would display the `message` in uppercase and the `name` in
   lowercase.

4. **SlicePipe**: The `slice` pipe is used to extract a portion of a
   string or an array. It accepts a start and optional end index and
   returns the sliced result. For example:

   ```html
   <p>{{ text | slice:0:10 }}</p>
   <ul>
     <li *ngFor="let item of items | slice:0:5">{{ item }}</li>
   </ul>
   ```

   This would display the first 10 characters of `text` and iterate over
   the first 5 items in the `items` array.

These are just a few examples of the many pipes available in Angular.
Pipes provide a convenient way to format, transform, and manipulate data
within templates, promoting reusability and maintainability of your
code. You can also create custom pipes to suit specific transformation
needs in your application.
