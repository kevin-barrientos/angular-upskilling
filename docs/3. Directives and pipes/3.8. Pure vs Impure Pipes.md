# Pure vs Impure Pipes

In Angular, there are three types of pipes:

1. **Pure Pipes**: Pure pipes are the most commonly used type of pipes.
   They are stateless and deterministic, meaning their output is solely
   based on their input. Pure pipes are re-evaluated only when the input
   values change, and Angular optimizes their execution to improve
   performance. Examples of pure pipes include `DatePipe`,
   `UpperCasePipe`, `LowerCasePipe`, etc.

2. **Impure Pipes**: Impure pipes are less commonly used and are marked
   with the `impure: true` flag in their decorator. They are stateful
   and can have side effects. Impure pipes are re-evaluated frequently,
   even if their input values don't change. This can impact performance,
   so they should be used with caution. The `async` pipe is an example
   of an impure pipe.

**It's important to consider the performance implications when using
pipes, especially impure pipes.** Excessive use of pipes or improper use
of impure pipes can impact the performance of your application.
Therefore, it's recommended to use pipes judiciously and consider
alternative approaches, such as using component methods or computed
properties, when necessary.
