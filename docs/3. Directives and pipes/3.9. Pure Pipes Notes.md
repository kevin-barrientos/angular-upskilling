# More on Pure Pipes

Pure pipes are generally more performant than invoking a component
method directly from the template. Pure pipes are optimized by Angular
to execute only when the input values change, reducing unnecessary
recalculations.

It is recommend using pure pipes over invoking component methods from
the template when the transformation can be achieved using a pipe. Here
are a few reasons why using pure pipes is preferable in such cases:

- Code Clarity: Pipes provide a clear and concise way to express data
  transformations directly within the template. It improves the
  readability and maintainability of your code by separating the
  transformation logic from the component methods.

- Reusability: Pure pipes can be easily reused across multiple components
  and templates within your application. Once created, they can be applied
  wherever the transformation is needed without duplicating code or
  defining additional component methods.

- Consistency: By using pure pipes, you can ensure consistent
  transformations are applied to the data throughout your application. If
  the same transformation is required in multiple places, using a pipe
  ensures a uniform approach, reducing the chance of inconsistencies or
  errors.

- Template Performance: Pure pipes are optimized by Angular to execute
  efficiently. By using pure pipes, you can leverage Angular's change
  detection mechanism to ensure that the transformation is performed only
  when necessary. This can lead to better performance compared to invoking
  component methods that may be called more frequently.

However, there might be cases where using a component method instead of
a pipe is more appropriate. For example:

- Complex Transformations: If the transformation logic is too complex or
  involves complex calculations, it may be more appropriate to use a
  component method to improve code readability and maintainability.

- Side Effects: If the transformation requires modifying component
  properties or triggering side effects, using a component method provides
  a clearer way to handle such scenarios.

In summary, pure pipes are generally recommended for simple data
transformations in order to improve code clarity, reusability, and
performance. However, for complex transformations or scenarios involving
side effects, using a component method can be a valid alternative.
