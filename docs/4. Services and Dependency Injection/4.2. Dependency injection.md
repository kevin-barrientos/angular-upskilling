Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern and a fundamental concept
in software development that allows components or classes to depend on
other components or services without creating them directly. Instead,
the dependencies are provided (injected) from external sources. DI helps
to decouple components, promotes reusability, and makes the code more
maintainable and testable.

In the context of Angular, DI is a core feature of the framework and
plays a crucial role in how components, services, and other objects are
instantiated and wired together. Here are the key points on how
dependency injection works in Angular:

1. **Provider Registration**: Dependencies are registered within
   Angular's dependency injection system using providers. Providers
   specify which objects or values should be injected when requested.
   Providers can be registered at the module level or at the component
   level.

2. **Injector**: The Injector is responsible for creating instances of
   objects and resolving their dependencies. It is a hierarchical
   tree-like structure that keeps track of registered providers and
   their dependencies. Angular creates a root injector for the
   application and creates child injectors for each component or
   lazy-loaded module.

3. **Constructor Injection**: The most common form of dependency
   injection in Angular is constructor injection. Dependencies are
   specified as constructor parameters in a component or service, and
   Angular's injector automatically resolves and injects the required
   dependencies when creating an instance of the class.

4. **Injection Tokens**: Dependencies are identified using injection
   tokens. Injection tokens can be classes, strings, or special tokens
   such as `InjectionToken`. When a dependency is requested, Angular's
   injector looks for a matching provider based on the injection token
   and provides the appropriate instance.

5. **Hierarchical Injection**: Angular's DI system follows a
   hierarchical structure. When a component requests a dependency,
   Angular checks the component's own injector first. If the dependency
   is not found, it looks up the injector hierarchy until it finds a
   matching provider. This allows dependencies to be shared at the
   appropriate level of the application, such as at the module or
   component level.

6. **Singletons and Scopes**: By default, services registered in the
   root injector have a singleton scope. This means that a single
   instance of the service is shared throughout the application.
   However, you can also register services with component-level or
   lazy-loaded module-level providers to create instances with different
   scopes.

7. **Testing and Mocking**: DI greatly facilitates testing in Angular.
   Dependencies can be easily mocked or substituted during unit tests by
   providing test-specific providers or using Angular's testing
   utilities. This allows for isolated testing of components and
   services.

By leveraging the power of DI, Angular promotes modularity, reusability,
and testability. It allows components and services to be loosely
coupled, makes it easier to manage dependencies, and facilitates the
creation and management of complex applications.
