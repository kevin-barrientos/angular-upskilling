# Routing and navigation

Routing and navigation are fundamental aspects of Angular applications, especially single-page applications (
SPAs). Here are the key concepts associated with Angular's routing and navigation system:

- Router Module: The primary module (RouterModule) provided by Angular that contains necessary directives and
  services for
  enabling client-side navigation.

- Router Outlet: A directive (<router-outlet></router-outlet>) that marks the spot in the template where the router should
  display the routed components.

- Routes: These are arrays of route objects that define paths to components. Each route typically has a path and a
  component, among other properties.

- RouterLink: A directive that binds a clickable HTML element to a route, making it easy to navigate between different
  components/views.

- RouterLinkActive: This directive will add a CSS class to an element when the linked route is active, making it useful
  for highlighting the current menu item, for example.

- Route Params: Parameters that can be passed in the URL. These are useful when you want to open a specific item's
  details, like /product/42.

- Query Params: Key-value pairs in the URL after the ?. They are different from route params and are often used for
  non-essential information like search filters.

- Route Guards: They are interfaces that can tell the router to allow or deny navigation to a requested route. Common
  guards include CanActivate, CanDeactivate, CanLoad, and others.

- Lazy Loading: A pattern where you split your application into multiple chunks and load them on demand. This can greatly
  improve initial loading times. In Angular, you can lazy-load entire feature modules.

- Route Resolvers: Functions that fetch data before navigating to a route. They can ensure that the necessary data is
  available before rendering a component.

- NavigationExtras: An optional object you can pass to the router's navigation function to control various aspects of the
  navigation process (e.g., queryParams, fragment, preserveQueryParams).

- Wildcard Route: A special route with path \*\* that catches any unmatched routes. It's usually used to show a 404 Not
  Found page.

- Redirects: Routes can be set up to redirect from one path to another. This can be useful for default routes, fixing
  changed URLs, or other redirection needs.

## More on Router and navigation

- Router State: At any point in time, the router has a specific state, which includes information like the active route,
  the URL, and the list of activated components.

- Router Events: Events that the router emits during its lifecycle, like NavigationStart, NavigationEnd, and
  NavigationCancel.

- Relative Navigation: While navigating, you can provide a path relative to the current path, rather than always
  specifying the absolute path.

- Route Data: Allows you to configure arbitrary data on a route in the route's definition. This can be useful for setting
  page titles, roles required, etc.

- Auxiliary Routes: Sometimes referred to as secondary routes, these allow for multiple named router outlets, letting you
  display multiple independent components in different areas of the screen.
