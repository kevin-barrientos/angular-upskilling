# Resolvers

Resolvers in Angular are used to fetch data before a route is activated. This can be particularly useful to ensure
that the necessary data for a component is already available by the time the component is rendered.

Here's a step-by-step example of creating a resolver:

### 1. Create a service that fetches data:

Let's assume we have a service called `DataService` that fetches some data:

```typescript
// data.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { of } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataService {
  fetchData() {
    return of({ message: 'Hello from DataService!' });
  }
}
```

### 2. Create the resolver:

Generate a new resolver using the Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate resolver data
```

Now, modify the created resolver:

```typescript
// data.resolver.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Resolve } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { DataService } from './data.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class DataResolver implements Resolve<any> {
  constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}

  resolve(): Observable<any> {
    return this.dataService.fetchData();
  }
}
```

### 3. Use the resolver in your routing configuration:

Add the resolver to a route in your routing configuration:

```typescript
// app-routing.module.ts
import { DataResolver } from './data.resolver';

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'example',
    component: ExampleComponent,
    resolve: {
      data: DataResolver,
    },
  },
  // ... other routes ...
];
```

### 4. Access the resolved data in your component:

In the component associated with the route, you can now access the resolved data:

```typescript
// example.component.ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: ` <div>{{ data?.message }}</div> `,
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  data: any;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.data = this.route.snapshot.data['data'];
  }
}
```

When you navigate to the route associated with `ExampleComponent`, the data will be fetched by the resolver before the
route is activated, and then it will be displayed by the component.

# Resolvers Considerations

Using resolvers in Angular provides the benefit of pre-fetching data before a route is activated. This ensures that the
necessary data for a component is available immediately when the component is rendered. However, there are some
disadvantages or considerations to be aware of when using resolvers:

1. **Delay in Navigation**:

- Since a resolver waits for the data to be loaded before activating a route, it can make the application feel slower,
  especially if the data-fetching operation is lengthy.
- Users might perceive the delay as a performance issue since they have to wait before seeing the content.

2. **Error Handling**:

- If there's an error in fetching data, the route won't be activated unless you handle the error properly.
- Proper error handling is required in the resolver to either redirect the user to another route or show an error
  message.

3. **Complexity**:

- For new developers or those unfamiliar with the concept, understanding the flow can be a bit complex.
- Resolvers add an extra layer of logic that developers need to account for when debugging or modifying routing
  behaviors.

4. **Less Reactive**:

- Since resolvers work by halting route activation until data is ready, they go against the reactive paradigm where
  components can be initialized and data can stream in when available.

5. **Over-fetching**:

- If multiple routes share a component and each route has its own resolver, there might be unnecessary data fetching.
- This could result in fetching more data than necessary, or fetching data more frequently than required.

6. **Tight Coupling**:

- If not designed carefully, resolvers can lead to tight coupling between the route configuration and specific data
  services, which might make refactoring or changes more challenging.

7. **Not Always Suitable for All Scenarios**:

- In some scenarios, like when displaying a loading indicator or skeleton screens while data is being fetched, resolvers
  might not be the best fit. Directly streaming data into the component without delaying route activation might be more
  appropriate in these cases.

Despite these cons, resolvers are a powerful feature in Angular's routing system. The key is understanding when and how
to use them effectively. As with many tools and features, the context and requirements of your application will
determine if resolvers are the right fit for your routing needs.
