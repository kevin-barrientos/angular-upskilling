Both Observables and Promises are constructs used for handling asynchronous operations, but they have some key
differences:

### Observable

1. **Lazy Execution**: Observables are lazy; they are not invoked until you subscribe to them. This means you can define
   an operation and chain configuration methods to it without triggering any action. The action is triggered
   when `subscribe()` is called.

2. **Multiple Values**: An Observable can emit multiple values over time. It can emit zero, one, or any number of values
   in its lifetime.

3. **Cancelability**: Observables are cancelable. This means that you can stop the execution of an Observable by
   unsubscribing from it, freeing up any resources that were allocated when you subscribed.

4. **Operators**: Observables come with a rich set of operators (like `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`, etc.) that can be
   used to compose complex asynchronous code.

5. **Stream-based**: Observables are more suited for stream-based, event-based, or multiple values scenarios.

6. **Error Handling**: Error handling in Observables can be done using specific operators like `catchError`, `retry`,
   etc.

7. **Multicast**: Observables can be either unicast or multicast. That means you can share an observable among multiple
   subscribers, and they might get the same value or different values depending on how the observable is implemented.

### Promise

1. **Eager Execution**: Promises are eager, meaning they execute immediately upon creation. There is no way to cancel
   the execution once it starts.

2. **Single Value**: A Promise is always single-valued; it either resolves to a value or rejects with an error. Once a
   Promise is resolved or rejected, its state cannot be changed.

3. **Non-Cancelable**: Promises are not cancelable. Once you set them in motion, they will go to their completion
   state ("resolved" or "rejected"), and you can't stop them.

4. **No Operators**: Promises lack the wide range of operators that Observables offer for operations like mapping to
   other data types, filtering, etc.

5. **Non-Stream Based**: Promises are more suited for single, one-time values and are not ideal for multiple values or
   streams of data.

6. **Error Handling**: Error handling in Promises is done using `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

7. **Unicast**: Promises are always multicast. If you have multiple `.then()` chained to a single Promise, they will all
   get the same resolved value.

| Feature        | Observable                         | Promise                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Execution      | Lazy                               | Eager                    |
| Values         | Multiple                           | Single                   |
| Cancelable     | Yes                                | No                       |
| Operators      | Many                               | None                     |
| Use Case       | Multiple values over time          | Single future value      |
| Error Handling | Multiple ways (`catchError`, etc.) | `.then()` and `.catch()` |
| Multicast      | Both Unicast and Multicast         | Always Multicast         |

Both have their uses, and choosing between them often depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. In
Angular, Observables are generally preferred due to their flexibility and the fact that Angularâ€™s HTTP module is
designed to work with Observables.
