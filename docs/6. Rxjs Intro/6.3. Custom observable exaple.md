Creating a custom Observable in RxJS can be done using the `Observable` class. Below is a simple example that
demonstrates creating a custom Observable from scratch. This Observable will emit numbers from 1 to 5, one per second,
and then complete.

Here's how you can create it:

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

const myObservable = new Observable<number>((observer) => {
  let count = 1;

  const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
    observer.next(count++);

    if (count > 5) {
      clearInterval(intervalId);
      observer.complete();
    }
  }, 1000);

  // This is optional and will be executed when the subscriber unsubscribes
  return () => {
    console.log('Observable cleaned up.');
    clearInterval(intervalId);
  };
});
```

In this example, the Observable emits numbers from 1 to 5 at an interval of one second. After emitting the number 5, it
clears the interval and completes the Observable.

You can subscribe to this Observable using the `subscribe` method, providing it with an Observer, which is just an
object with `next`, `error`, and `complete` methods.

Here's how you can subscribe to it:

```typescript
const subscription = myObservable.subscribe({
  next(value) {
    console.log(`Received value: ${value}`);
  },
  error(err) {
    console.log(`Something went wrong: ${err}`);
  },
  complete() {
    console.log('Done emitting values.');
  },
});

// Output will be:
// Received value: 1
// Received value: 2
// Received value: 3
// Received value: 4
// Received value: 5
// Done emitting values.
```

And if you want to unsubscribe before the Observable is complete, you can simply call `subscription.unsubscribe()`.

```typescript
// To unsubscribe after 3 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
  subscription.unsubscribe();
}, 3000);

// Output will be:
// Received value: 1
// Received value: 2
// Received value: 3
// Observable cleaned up.
```

This is a basic example to get you started, but you can create more complex Observables to suit your needs.
