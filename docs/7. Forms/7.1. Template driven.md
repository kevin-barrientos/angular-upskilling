Angular offers two ways to handle forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Here, we'll focus on the former.

### Template-Driven Forms

Template-driven forms leverage the power of Angular templates to manage form controls and handle form validation.
They're best suited for simpler scenarios and are more concise than reactive forms. Here are the key concepts around
them:

1. **FormsModule**: This is the module you need to import to use template-driven forms. It provides the necessary
   directives and services for making template-driven forms work.

   ```typescript
   import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
   ```

2. **ngModel**: It's a directive used to bind input, select and textarea to properties on the model. Using `[(ngModel)]`
   establishes a two-way data binding on an `<input>` form element.

   ```html
   <input [(ngModel)]="name" />
   ```

3. **ngForm**: It's a directive attached automatically by Angular to every `<form>` tag. When you import `FormsModule`,
   you can access the `ngForm` directive, which provides you with a top-level `FormGroup` instance.

4. **Form Controls (ngModel)**: Each form input element has an associated `FormControl` instance, and they collectively
   form the model of our form. They track the value, user interaction, and validation status of the form input elements.

5. **Two-Way Data Binding**: A significant feature of template-driven forms. When you use `[(ngModel)]`, it not only
   binds the input value to the model, but changes in the model are also reflected back into the view.

6. **Validation**: Angular provides a set of built-in validators such as `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, etc.
   These can be applied directly in the template.

   ```html
   <input [(ngModel)]="name" required />
   ```

7. **Form States**: Form controls have various states like `dirty`, `pristine`, `valid`, `touched`, `untouched`, etc.
   These states give you insight into the lifecycle and validity of each form control.

8. **ngModelGroup**: For grouping controls, you can use the `ngModelGroup` directive to create a sub-group of controls.

   ```html
   <div ngModelGroup="address">
     <input [(ngModel)]="street" name="street" />
     <input [(ngModel)]="city" name="city" />
   </div>
   ```

9. **Submitting Forms**: Use `(ngSubmit)` event binding on the form tag to handle form submissions.

   ```html
   <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
     <!-- ... -->
     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>
   ```

10. **Accessing Controls**: You can access form controls in your component class by using `@ViewChild`.

    ```typescript
    @ViewChild('formDirective') formDirective: NgForm;
    ```

11. **Setting Form Model**: For scenarios where you want to set the form model directly, you can use the `ngModel` with
    the `ngModelOptions` directive.

    ```html
    <input [(ngModel)]="name" [ngModelOptions]="{standalone: true}" />
    ```

### Advantages of Template-Driven Forms:

- More concise than reactive forms.
- Suitable for simple scenarios.
- You don't need to create FormControl and FormGroup instances in your component; Angular handles it.

### Limitations of Template-Driven Forms:

- Less scalable than reactive forms.
- Not the best choice for complex scenarios or when you want more granular control over validation and form logic.
- Harder to unit test compared to reactive forms.

In conclusion, while template-driven forms offer a quick and straightforward way to handle form scenarios in Angular,
for more complex, dynamic, or large-scale forms, you might want to consider using reactive forms.
