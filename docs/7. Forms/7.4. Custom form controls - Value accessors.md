Creating a custom form control component in Angular that implements `ControlValueAccessor` allows your component to
integrate with Angular forms (`FormControl`, `FormGroup`, etc.). By doing so, you can encapsulate complex behavior or
custom input design patterns while still using the powerful features of Angular forms.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating such a custom control:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Component

Create a new component for your custom form control.

```bash
ng generate component custom-input
```

### Step 2: Implement `ControlValueAccessor`

The core of making a component work as a form control is implementing the `ControlValueAccessor` interface.

```typescript
import { Component, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';
import { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-custom-input',
  template: ` <input [(ngModel)]="value" (input)="onChange($event.target.value)" (blur)="onTouched()" /> `,
  providers: [
    {
      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
      useExisting: forwardRef(() => CustomInputComponent),
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
})
export class CustomInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
  // The internal data model for form control value
  private _value: any;

  // Function to call when the control value changes
  onChange: (value: any) => void = () => {};

  // Function to call when the control is touched
  onTouched: () => void = () => {};

  // Method that writes a new value to the element
  writeValue(value: any): void {
    this._value = value;
  }

  // Registers a callback function that should be called when the control's value changes in the UI
  registerOnChange(fn: any): void {
    this.onChange = fn;
  }

  // Registers a callback to be triggered when the control has been touched
  registerOnTouched(fn: any): void {
    this.onTouched = fn;
  }

  get value(): any {
    return this._value;
  }

  set value(val: any) {
    this._value = val;
    this.onChange(val);
    this.onTouched();
  }
}
```

A few key points:

- **NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR**: This is a token that represents a ControlValueAccessor for use with Angular forms. We're
  providing our component as the accessor.

- **onChange**: This function will be replaced by Angular with a function that updates the form control value in the
  form API (like `FormControl.setValue()`). We'll call this whenever our internal value changes.

- **onTouched**: Similar to `onChange`, but this one is for the touch event.

- **writeValue**: This is a method that writes a new value from the form model into the view or (if needed) updates the
  local data model.

### Step 3: Use Your Custom Control in a Form

Now you can use your custom control just like any other form control!

```html
<form [formGroup]="myForm">
  <app-custom-input formControlName="customInput"></app-custom-input>
</form>
```

And in your component:

```typescript
this.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({
  customInput: [''],
});
```

### Optional: Validator and AsyncValidator Integration

If you want your custom control to integrate with validators or async validators, you'd also implement the `Validator`
or `AsyncValidator` interfaces and register them with the `NG_VALIDATORS` or `NG_ASYNC_VALIDATORS` tokens respectively.

In conclusion, `ControlValueAccessor` allows you to create custom components that can be seamlessly used in Angular's
form ecosystem, giving you the flexibility to design unique form controls while benefiting from the robustness of
Angular's form handling.
