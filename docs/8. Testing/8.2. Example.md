Let's create a simple component and a unit test for that component using Angular, Jasmine, and Karma.

### 1. **Component: SimpleCounterComponent**

This component will simply increment a counter when a button is clicked.

**simple-counter.component.ts:**

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-simple-counter',
  template: `
    <button (click)="increment()">Increment</button>
    <p>Current count: {{ count }}</p>
  `,
})
export class SimpleCounterComponent {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Test: SimpleCounterComponent**

We'll test that when the "Increment" button is clicked, the count is increased by 1.

**simple-counter.component.spec.ts:**

```typescript
import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { SimpleCounterComponent } from './simple-counter.component';

describe('SimpleCounterComponent', () => {
  let component: SimpleCounterComponent;
  let fixture: ComponentFixture<SimpleCounterComponent>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
      declarations: [SimpleCounterComponent],
    }).compileComponents();
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(SimpleCounterComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });

  it('should create', () => {
    expect(component).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('should increment the count by 1 when the button is clicked', () => {
    expect(component.count).toBe(0); // Initial count should be 0

    const buttonElement = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector('button');
    buttonElement.click();

    fixture.detectChanges();

    expect(component.count).toBe(1); // Count should now be 1
  });
});
```

### 3. **Execution**

With Karma set up (as it is by default with Angular CLI projects), you would run:

```bash
ng test
```

This will compile your Angular app, start the Karma test runner, and execute your Jasmine tests. In the example above,
the tests check if the component is created correctly and if the counter increments as expected.

Note: For this example to work, make sure that you've set up a new Angular project using the Angular CLI and added
the `SimpleCounterComponent` and its test to the project. The above is a simplified example to illustrate the core
concepts. In a real-world scenario, you might have more complex components and tests, but the fundamental approach would
remain the same.
