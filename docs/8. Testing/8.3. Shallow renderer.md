`shallow-render` is a third-party library for Angular that provides utilities for shallow rendering components in
tests, similar in philosophy to how React's shallow rendering with enzyme works.

Here are some of the benefits and features of using `shallow-render` in Angular:

1. **Isolation**: It ensures that the component under test is isolated from child components, making the unit tests more
   focused and faster.

2. **Mocked Child Components**: The library automatically mocks child components, so you don't have to manually stub or
   mock them.

3. **Override Providers**: You can easily override providers, directives, and more for your tests.

4. **Simpler Test Configuration**: The API simplifies the boilerplate code often required for setting up Angular tests.

### Example using `shallow-render`:

Suppose you have a `MyComponent` component which uses a child component called `ChildComponent`. Here's how you might
set up a test with `shallow-render`:

```typescript
import { Shallow } from 'shallow-render';
import { MyComponent } from './my.component';
import { MyModule } from './my.module';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  let shallow: Shallow<MyComponent>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    shallow = new Shallow(MyComponent, MyModule);
  });

  it('should create', async () => {
    const { instance } = await shallow.render();
    expect(instance).toBeTruthy();
  });

  // Add more tests as needed...
});
```

In this example, the `Shallow` class is used to set up and render the component. The `ChildComponent` is automatically
mocked, so you don't need to deal with its behavior or template in these tests.
